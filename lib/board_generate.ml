(** Fills a 3x3 diagonal box with random numbers 1-9.

    Diagonal boxes at positions (0,0), (3,3), and (6,6) don't share rows,
    columns, or overlap with each other, so they can be filled independently.
    This reduces the complexity of completing the board later. *)

(** Completes the board using backtracking after diagonal boxes are filled.

    Traverses the board row by row, column by column. For each empty cell, tries
    numbers 1-9 in random order until finding one that satisfies Sudoku
    constraints. If no number works, backtracks and tries a different number in
    the previous cell. *)

(** Gets all positions with Fixed cells in random order.

    Returns an array of (row, col) coordinates for all cells that contain Fixed

(** Removes cells from the board while ensuring the puzzle keeps exactly one
    solution.

    Algorithm:

    1. Get all filled cell positions in random order

    2. For each position, temporarily remove the cell

    3. Check if the puzzle still has exactly one solution

    4. If yes, keep the removal; if no, restore the cell

    5. Continue until we've removed enough cells or no more can be safely
    removed

    This guarantees that the final puzzle has exactly one unique solution. *)

(** Generates a Sudoku puzzle with the specified difficulty.

    Three-phase process:

    1. Fill diagonal 3Ã—3 boxes with random numbers (reduces complexity)

    2. Complete the entire board using backtracking

    3. Remove cells strategically while maintaining exactly one solution

    The result is a valid Sudoku puzzle with exactly one unique solution.
    Difficulty is controlled by how many cells are removed:
    - Easy: ~35 cells removed (~57% filled)
    - Medium: ~45 cells removed (~44% filled)
    - Hard: ~55 cells removed (~32% filled)

    Note: Actual number of removed cells may be less than the target if removing
    more would create multiple solutions. *)
